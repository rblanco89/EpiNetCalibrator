# EpiNetCalibrator
Calibration of parameters in epidemic networks

## How to use

First, you need to compile the epidemic network simulation code. There is a Makefile that works with the `make` command in most Linux operating systems.

The Python notebook contains the code to calibrate the parameters using the results of the simulations running in the C code (epidemic simulator) and the Differential Evolution optimizer. The template parameter file can be modified parameters also change the network structure.
